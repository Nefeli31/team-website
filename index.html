    <h1><b>Welcome to Penguin Wiki</b></h1>

          How many types of penguins are there? There are currently 18
          recognized species of penguins around the world, as determined by
          various agencies, scientists and experts in the field. Penguins live
          in many locations around the Southern Hemisphere. At very quick glance
          they look alike with white and black bodies, but they all have unique
          characteristics.
        </div>
        <div class="col-4">
          A group of penguins in the water is called a raft but on land they’re
          called a waddle! Other names for a group of penguins include rookery,
          colony, and huddle.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-4">
          The black and white “tuxedo” look donned by most penguin species is a
          clever camouflage called countershading. When swimming, the black on
          their backs helps them blend in with the darkness of the ocean from
          predators viewing from above. Their white bellies help them blend in
          with the bright surface of the ocean when viewed by predators and prey
          from below.
        </div>
        <div class="col-4">
          Penguins may huddle together for several reasons. This behavior helps
          these birds protect themselves from predators. In frigid habitats,
          huddling helps penguins retain warmth.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row justify-content-end">
        <div class="col-4">
          Penguins evolved to fly underwater. Most birds have hollow, air-filled
          bones to help them stay light for flight. Penguins adapted with solid
          bones instead. This helps them swim because solid bones reduce
          buoyancy—the tendency to float.
        </div>
        <div class="col-4">
          A penguin’s thick feathers aren’t the only way this bird stays warm. A
          gland near the base of its tail provides waterproof oil. Penguins
          spend several hours each day covering their feathers with this oil and
          give extra attention to the task before swimming.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row justify-content-around">
        <div class="col-4">
          Penguins live in many locations and habitats. You can find them in
          Antarctica and Antarctic islands, the Galapagos Islands off the coast
          of Ecuador, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, Peru and Chile.
        </div>
        <div class="col-4">
          Contrary to many popular holiday cartoons, you’ll never see penguins
          and polar bears together in the wild. That’s because penguins live
          south of the equator while polar bears north of the equator in Arctic!
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-4">
          Penguin feet are adapted to walk long distances. Some species of
          penguins can march up to about 60 miles across sea ice to get to their
          breeding grounds. Penguin feet are also adapted to help the birds
          steer while swimming. They use their feet like rudders, angling them
          to help control direction.
        </div>
        <div class="col-4">
          According to some animal experts, the penguin is one of the most
          streamlined animals in the world. A penguin’s body is tapered at both
          ends and it has a large head, short neck and elongated body. This
          streamlined design helps penguins swim fast.
